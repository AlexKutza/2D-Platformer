# 2D-Platformer
Project 4 for MSCH-C 220 
11/10

This is a 2D platformer where the character plays as a worm trapped in a cave. All jewels must be collected, and enemies must be avoided or killed before the player can exit through the crystal portal.

## Implementation

This game was built with Godot 4.1. I included the following features:
- Origional tileset with foreground and platform tiles
- In-depth level design with varied paths
- Player movement, including attack and jump
- An origional enemy design with multiple animations
- A flying enemy with different movement
- A jewel-collection system that tracks score
- Conditional ending based on collecting enough jewels
- Text displays to inform the player when they don't have enough jewels
- Origional music
- Localized audio and particle effects for jewels
- Main menu and ending screen, including a controls panel

## What Makes this a Game?
This is a game because the player has autonomy over movement. They can strategize based on which path they want to take, or which order they want to collect the jewels in. They also have to deal with different enemy types. The player can have improve competence in the game as they develop better strategies for defeating the enemies or collecting the jewels. They might also try speed running the game in as fast a possible. The game also promotes relatedness becuase the player can feel immersed in the environment through music, sound effects, and visuals, and feel connected to the worm character.

## Future Development
I would like to fix some bugs in the graphics, such as the jittery tilesets and the fact that the player sometimes glitches, losing the ability to jump. I would also like to add more types of enemies and improve their movement, as well as more levels that increase in difficulty. I wanted to add sound effects for enemies, and ambient lighting, but I ran out of time.
